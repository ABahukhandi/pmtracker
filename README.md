# PM Tracker

PM Tracker helps you keep track of what our Prime Minister has been upto in
recent times. It is available at https://pmtracker.in

It is a static website created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and the
source code is available at https://github.com/chaitanyagupta/pmtracker

## Contributing

All the relevant data is available under `_data/`.

* `_data/activities.yml`: All of PM's activity data is kept here. This is the
  file that gets updated manually (for now!) as the PM's whereabouts become
  known.
* `_data/places.json`: Auto-generated place information.
* `_data/pm.yml`: Information about the current Prime Minister
* `_data/meta.yml`: Information about the PM Tracker itself
